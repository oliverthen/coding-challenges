# Coding Challenges

John Crickett Coding Challanges are meant to improve one own's skill by building real applications.

Each folder contains my own personal solution to various coding challanges along with a README file that describes how to run that solution. These solutions will be written in Python.

Below is a link to the Coding Challanges website which contains all of the coding challenges.
